# Hello-World
My first Git repository, a simple learning example


I wrote a brief history of my programming career beginning in 1972 when I went to work for Texas Instruments, in their Science Service
Division, developing and supporting Operating System Software. The operating system ran and managed Geophysical Data processing software
for Geophysical Services, a subsidiary of Texas Instruments. The preferred programming language was Fortran and assembly language for the
Texas Instruments 870 Microprocessor.

In 1976 I transferred from the Science Service Division of Texas Instruments to the Semi Conduction Division.  This was a switch from data
processing to factory automation and the programming language from Fortran and Assembly languages to programming exclusively in assembly
language for the Texas Instruments 980 and 990 Microprocessors.  This continued until early mid 1980's where we switched from using Texas
Instruments 980 Microprocessors to using Motorola 68000 series of Microprocessors and at the same time switching to C programming
language from assembly language.

In early 1990 started developing using C++ programming language, for the Intel microprocessor, and started using Microsoft Windows operating system, rather then an OS developed by TI

Retired from Texas Instruments in 1998 and went to work for EDS (Electronic Data System).  The programming language of choice at EDS was primarily UNIX Shell scripts. In 2006 EDI shutdown operations in Little Rock and rather then relocate I elected to retire from EDI.

My current employment with Nebraska Book Company started in 2011. Programming at NBC uses C++ and now C# and SQL scripting language
